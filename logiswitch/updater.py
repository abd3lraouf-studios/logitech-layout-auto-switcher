"""Self-update: pull the latest release wheel and install it into this venv.

The command is invoked manually and is a *separate process* from the background
``watch`` agent, so it can stop that agent, replace the package, and restart it
without ever replacing itself mid-flight.

Network access uses only the standard library so this adds no dependency. The
wheel is fetched from the project's GitHub release -- the same artifact the
release workflow already publishes -- so no PyPI account or token is needed and
there is a single source of truth for "latest".

Order matters on Windows: a running process holds its package directory's files,
so the service is stopped *before* pip writes the new wheel and started again
afterwards. If the install fails the old version is still on disk and the restart
brings it back, so a botched update never leaves the machine without an agent.
