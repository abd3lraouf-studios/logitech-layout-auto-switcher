"""What the *host* thinks the keyboard is, and who else is talking to it.

logiswitch sets the keyboard's firmware platform. That is only one of the two
things deciding which character a keypress produces -- the host's own input source
decides the rest, and nothing here manages it. A machine sitting in a non-Latin
layout types an entirely different alphabet no matter what the firmware is set to,
and the daemon had no way to see that: it would report success while the wrong
script appeared on screen.

So this module reads the host's current keyboard language and notes whether other
Logitech software is running, on macOS and Windows alike. Everything is read-only
and best-effort, and returns :data:`UNKNOWN` rather than raising -- a diagnostic
that can break the thing it is diagnosing is worse than no diagnostic.
